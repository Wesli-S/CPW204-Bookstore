## Getting Started

### How to Install TypeScript
- Download & Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
Note: (Make sure you install the LTS version)
- In the command line, run this exact command: `npm instal -g typescript`

### Compile TypeScript
To compile the TypeScript files with the watch option, run the following command:
`tsc --watch`. Using the watch option only requires us to compile once each time the
project is opened.
